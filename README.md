# In this project, we gather, assess, and clean data then act on it wrangling the data.

- WeRateDogs Twitter archive was downloaded from Ucadity ( given to us by dowloading it from the classroom)
- Twitter Image Prediction (Image_predictions.tsv) was dowloaded programmatically from URL using the Requests library
- Additional data from Twitter was downloaded using Twitter API (Tweepy) as stored as tweets_data.txt

### Data was then assessed visually and programmatically before being cleaned for exploratory analysis    
_NB: API keys were removed from the work before submitting._
